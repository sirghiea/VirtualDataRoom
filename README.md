# Virtual Data Room

A secure, browser-based document repository built for managing due diligence workflows. Think Google Drive or Dropbox, scoped to a single "Data Room" that acts as the top-level container for organizing and viewing documents.

## Live Demo

The app is deployed and ready to use — no setup required. Try creating a data room, uploading PDFs, and organizing folders directly in the browser.

## Features

- **Data Room Management** - Create, rename, and delete data rooms. Each data room is an isolated container with its own folder hierarchy.
- **Nested Folders** - Create folders at any depth. A collapsible sidebar tree and breadcrumb trail let you navigate the hierarchy quickly.
- **PDF Upload & Viewing** - Upload PDF files (up to 50 MB) and view them in a full-screen viewer with page navigation, zoom controls, and keyboard shortcuts.
- **Rename & Delete** - Every item (data room, folder, file) can be renamed or deleted via a kebab menu. Deleting a folder cascades to all nested content, with a confirmation dialog showing the impact count.
- **Duplicate Name Handling** - Folders with duplicate names are rejected with an error. Files with duplicate names are automatically suffixed (e.g., `report (1).pdf`).
- **Persistent Storage** - All data is stored in IndexedDB and survives page refreshes. No server required.
- **Responsive Layout** - Sidebar collapses on tablet widths; mobile gets a full-width content area.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **npm** >= 9

### Installation

## How to Use the App

### 1. Create a Data Room

From the home page, click **"New Data Room"**, give it a name, and press **Create**. You'll be taken straight into the explorer view.

### 2. Organize with Folders

Click **"New Folder"** in the toolbar to create a folder inside the current directory. Double-click any folder to navigate into it. Use the **sidebar tree** or **breadcrumb trail** to jump to any level of the hierarchy.

### 3. Upload PDFs

Click **"Upload PDF"** in the toolbar and select a `.pdf` file from your computer. The file appears in the current folder. Only PDF files up to 50 MB are accepted; all other types are rejected with an error message.

### 4. View a PDF

Double-click a file (or use the kebab menu and choose **View**) to open the full-screen PDF viewer. Controls:

| Action          | How                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Next page       | Right arrow key or `>` button |
| Previous page   | Left arrow key or `<` button  |
| Zoom in/out     | `+` / `-` buttons            |
| Reset zoom      | Fit-width button             |
| Close viewer    | `Esc` key or `X` button      |

### 5. Rename or Delete Items

Click the **three-dot menu** on any data room card, folder, or file to see **Rename** and **Delete** options. Deleting a folder shows how many subfolders and files will be removed before you confirm.

## Design Decisions

### Why IndexedDB instead of localStorage?

localStorage is limited to ~5 MB of string data. IndexedDB supports structured storage of large binary blobs (ArrayBuffers), which is essential for storing PDF files in the browser. The `idb` library provides a clean Promise-based wrapper that keeps the code readable.

### Why Context + useReducer instead of Redux or Zustand?

For an MVP with a single global store and straightforward CRUD actions, React's built-in Context + `useReducer` pattern is sufficient and avoids adding another dependency. The reducer centralizes state transitions, making the data flow predictable without the boilerplate of Redux.

### Blob separation from file metadata

File metadata (`FileEntry`) is stored in one IndexedDB object store, while the raw PDF binary is stored in a separate `blobs` store keyed by a UUID (`blobKey`). This separation means listing files is fast (no large blobs loaded), and blob cleanup is handled transactionally during delete operations.

### Recursive cascade deletes

Deleting a folder traverses all descendants using a BFS queue, collects every child folder and file, then performs a single IndexedDB transaction to remove everything atomically. This ensures no orphaned records are left behind.

### Compound indexes for efficient queries

The `folders` and `files` stores use compound indexes (e.g., `[dataRoomId, parentId]`) so that listing the children of a specific folder is a single indexed lookup rather than a full table scan followed by filtering.

### Native `<dialog>` element

All modals use the native HTML `<dialog>` element with `showModal()`, which provides built-in focus trapping, backdrop, and `Esc` to close — without needing a third-party modal library.

### Tailwind v4 CSS-based theming

Instead of a `tailwind.config.js` file, the project uses Tailwind v4's `@theme` directive in CSS to define design tokens (colors, radii, fonts). This keeps the theme co-located with styles and eliminates a config file.
